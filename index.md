In Iceland, lifting stones were categorized into the

- fullsterkur ("full strength") weighing 154 kg (341 pounds)
- hálfsterkur ("half strength") at 100 kg (228.8 pounds)
- hálfdrættingur ("weakling") at 54 kg (107.8 pounds) and
- amlóði ("useless") at 23 kg (50.6 pounds)

They were traditionally used to qualify men for work on fishing boats, with the hálfdrættingur being the minimum weight a man would have to lift onto a ledge at hip-height to qualify. One such set of stones can be found on the beach of Djúpalónssandur at the foot of Snæfellsjökull. One of the most famous Icelandic stones is the Husafell Stone which weighs 186 kg (410 lb).
